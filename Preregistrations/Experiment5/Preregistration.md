# Experiment 3 Preregistration


## Design

We are interested in whether people interpreted our statements about 'risk' as clearly indicating that a bad outcome was likely, and whether it is easy to come up with less costly solutions to the same problem. To that end we are presenting participants with the first part of the vignettes from Experiment 1, and manipulating only Risk, between-subjects. The full design is a mixed 2 (Risk, between-subjects: High, Low) x 2 (Scenario, within-subjects: Dam, Fire).


## Planned sample size and stopping rule

We plan to recruit 20 participants for each Risk condition (40 total) from Amazon Mechanical Turk using CloudResearch, evenly split between both between-subjects conditions. This sample size was determined by a power analysis which found that this sample size provided 80% power to detect a main effect of Risk in a mixed-model ANOVA with an effect size of Cohen's *f* = .32 (corresponding to a partial eta-squared of .09).

We include one reading comprehension question for each scenario, which will be used as exclusion criteria. If participants get either wrong, they will be excluded and replaced. In addition, we have a final follow-up question which asks "how engaged were you with this survey?" and provides a 0-100 scale with 0 labeled "not paying attention at all" and 100 labeled "fully engaged". Any participants who answer below 60 will be excluded and replaced.

## Planned analyses 

Each participant reads 2 scenarios in random order. The two primary DVs are the probability estimate and the "can you think of a less costly solution" question. 

For the probability estimate, we will conduct a simple 2 (Risk) x 2 (Scenario) mixed-model ANOVA, predicting that we should see a main effect of Risk such that estimates in the high-risk condition are higher than those in the low-risk condition. We will also examine whether average estimated probability in each of these four cells is significantly greater or less than 50%, using a simple one-sample *t*-test (two-tailed).

For the "can you think of a less costly solution" question, we are merely interested in how many participants are able to provide such a solution, and so we will simply report descriptive statistics.
