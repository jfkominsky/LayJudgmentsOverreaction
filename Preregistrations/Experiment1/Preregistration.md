# Experiment 1 Preregistration


## Design

We are interested in how people make judgments about whether an intervention is reasonable or an overreaction based on three factors: How high the risk of a bad event is, whether the bad event occurs, and whether the occurrence of the bad outcome is causally related to the intervention (prevented by it vs. an outside factor, or overwhelms the intervention vs. occurs due to outside factors.)

The study involves a 2 (Risk: high vs. low) x 2 (Outcome occurs: Yes vs. No) x 2 (Outcome causally connected to intervention: Yes vs. No) between-subjects manipulation with 2 measurements, the first after the risk manipulation, and the second after the outcome manipulations. There are two scenarios per participant, which will be included as a random factor in the analysis (see below).

## Planned sample size and stopping rule

We plan to recruit 320 participants from Prolific Academic, evenly split across all 8 between-subjects conditions, so 40 per condition. We include two simple reading comprehension questions for each scenario. Any participant who fails to answer any of these questions correctly will be removed and replaced by subsequent recruitment until the target sample size is reached.

## Planned analyses and power analysis 


Each participant reads 2 scenarios in random order.We will first conduct separate analyses of the t1 and t2 ratings that include scenario as an additional factor. The t1 rating analysis will only look at risk and scenario (as outcome is only introduced after the t1 rating), while the t2 rating will include all three between-subjects factors and scenario. If these analyses reveal any effect or interactions with scenario, we will conduct all further analyses separately for each scenario. If there are no interactions, we will collapse across scenario for all further analyses.

We conducted a G* power analysis of a mixed-model design with 8 factors and 2 measurements, which indicated 80% power to detect an interaction with Cohen's *f* effect-size of .21 or greater, corresponding to a medium-sized effect.

There will be three primary analyses. First, we will conduct separate analyses of t1 and t2 ratings. The t1 ratings analysis will be a simple independent-samples *t*-test, with Risk as the only factor. The t2 ratings analysis will be a 2x2x2 ANOVA with all three between-subjects factors. The third analysis will be another 2x2x2 ANOVA examining difference scores, t2-t1.

A G* power analysis indicates that these 2x2x2 factorial ANOVAs will have 80% power to detect a Cohen's *f* of .157, corresponding to a small-to-medium effect size.
