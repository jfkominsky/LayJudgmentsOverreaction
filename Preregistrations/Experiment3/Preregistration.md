# Experiment 3 Preregistration


## Design

We are interested in how people make judgments about whether an intervention is reasonable or an overreaction based on three factors: The risk of a bad outcome, whether the intervention is intended to prevent the bad outcome altogether or merely mitigate it, and whether the intervention is successful.

This yields a 2 (Risk: High vs. Low) x 2 (Intent: Prevent vs. Mitigate) x 2 (Outcome: Good vs. Bad) design,between-subjects manipulation with 2 measurements, the first after the risk and intent manipulations, and the second after the outcome manipulation. There are two scenarios per participant, which will be included as a random factor in the analysis (see below).


## Planned sample size and stopping rule

We plan to recruit 320 participants from Prolific Academic, evenly split across all 8 between-subjects conditions, so 40 per condition. We include three reading comprehension question for each scenario, two of which will be used as exclusion criteria: the one checking whether they recognize the high vs. low risk manipulation, and the one checking whether they recognize the prevent vs. mitigate manipulation. Any participant who fails to answer either of these questions correctly will be removed and replaced by subsequent recruitment until the target sample size is reached. As the outcome measure involves what might be considered a subjective judgment (about the relative level of damage), it will not be used as an exclusion criterion.

## Planned analyses and power analysis 

Each participant reads 2 scenarios in random order. We will first conduct separate analyses of the t1 and t2 ratings that include scenario as an additional factor. The t1 rating analysis will look at scenario, risk, and intent, while the t2 rating will include all between-subjects factors and scenario. If these analyses reveal any effect or interactions with scenario, we will conduct all further analyses separately for each scenario. If there are no interactions, we will collapse across scenario for all further analyses. Based on Experiment 1, we expect the former, since risk and scenario alone interacted in that experiment (which had no intent manipulation).

We conducted a G* power analysis of a mixed-model design with 8 factors and 2 measurements, which indicated 80% power to detect an interaction with Cohen's *f* effect-size of .21 or greater, corresponding to a medium-sized effect.

There will be three primary analyses. First, we will conduct separate analyses of t1 and t2 ratings. The t1 ratings analysis will be a 2x2 ANOVA, with Risk and Intent. The t2 ratings analysis will be a 2x2x2 ANOVA with all three between-subjects factors. The third analysis will be another 2x2x2 ANOVA examining difference scores, t2-t1.

A G* power analysis indicates that these 2x2x2 factorial ANOVAs will have 80% power to detect a Cohen's *f* of .157, corresponding to a small-to-medium effect size.
