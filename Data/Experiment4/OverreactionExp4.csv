My thoughts and feelings about things tend to evolve with whatever I can observe, and the information that I am getting or seeing. Those questions were very difficult for me to answer. How does a person choose between what the best decisions are when every single has serious consequences for certain groups of people. How are we all supposed to choose between who deserves to be hurt the least? Closing everything down hurts a lot of people, mask mandates mean that people who cant wear one who cant afford delivery have to go anyway and get bullied and tormented every where they go just trying to get their grorcery shopping done. Constant isolation increasing suicide and drug use. I have been suicidal so many times this last year when I finally had made progress with my mental health. When every decisions has such great cost, how does one quantify the quality of these decisions by a simple scale for an entire period of a year of an ever evolving situation? No matter what we decide its just choosing between one kind of death and other kinds of death. This whole situation is just completely terrible in every kind of way and no matter what any of us decide to do about it other people will die from that choice. Save people with covid measures kill people who die from factors or isolation and being locked in with abuse. Impossible choices. Impossible. "
