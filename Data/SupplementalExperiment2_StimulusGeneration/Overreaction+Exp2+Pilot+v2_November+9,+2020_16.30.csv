The information in this consent form will provide more details about the research study and what will be asked of you if you choose to take part in it. If you have any questions, you should feel free to ask them and should expect to be given answers you completely understand.  If you wish to take part in the research study, you will be asked to indicate so on this consent form. You are not giving up any of your legal rights by agreeing to take part in this research.



Who is conducting this study?

This research study is conducted by the research laboratories of Dr. Elizabeth Bonawitz and Dr. Vanessa LoBue. The Principal Investigators have the overall responsibility for the conduct of the research. However, there are often other individuals who are part of the research team.



Why is this study being done?                              

The purpose of this research is to understand how people are able to learn so much about the different objects they encounter in the world around them. We are currently studying individuals’ learning and development in multiple domains, including emotional, cognitive, and conceptual.

 

What will I be asked to do if I take part in this study?

This session will last approximately 10 to 60 minutes. In most cases, we will only ask to see you for one, but possibly several brief sessions. During the session, you will be presented with objects or images, you may watch a video clip, perform a computer task, read brief paragraphs, look at pictures, and/or answer a series of questionnaires. You may be asked to make judgements, answer questions (such as making predictions and providing explanations), learn from and teach others, observe events as well as perform actions such as moving or reaching toward certain objects, grouping objects, or activating toys. There are no “right or wrong” responses to any of these questions or tasks—we simply want to find out how people approach objects and situations. Please note that you are NOT being evaluated academically or psychologically, we are simply conducting basic research.



What are the risks of harm or discomforts I might experience if I take part in this study?

There are no foreseeable risks to participate in this study.



Are there any benefits to me if I choose to take part in this study?

While participation in this research provides no direct benefit to you, the results will help us learn about cognitive, emotional, and conceptual development.



Will I be paid to take part in this study?

Some participants may be paid for taking part in the research, depending on the study and the platform on which the study is hosted. Student participants receive RU points as compensation, while participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk are compensated via the MTurk platform. Other participants, such as adult online participants and non-student participants in the lab, may be compensated in the form of a small gift card or cash.



What are my alternatives if I do not want to take part in this study?

Your alternative is not to take part in this study.



Audio/ video recording:

We will video and/or audio record the session, except in cases where recording would be impossible, such as for studies conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Recordings are used for research purposes. Digital copies are kept in the lab. Name anonymized videos are viewed for purposes of data analysis and training. Only authorized research personnel may view these recordings. Recordings will not be shown, either publicly or as part of the presentation of data, unless you give your permission on the form below. The results of our studies are reported as group response patterns. The responses of your child do not make them identifiable. The data we collect are confidential, and we do not disclose results from any individual participant to parents, subjects, or the university.



How will information about me be kept private or confidential?

All efforts will be made to keep your responses confidential, but total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. The results of our studies are always reported in the form of group averages and individuals are not identifiable. The data we collect are confidential, and we do not disclose results from any individual participant to parents, subjects, or the university. We will know your IP address when you respond to the research through services such as Qualtrics or MTurk. We may ask you to include your age, gender, phone number, and/or address when you complete the study, and this information will be stored in such a manner that some linkage between your identity and your responses in the research exists. Please note that we will keep this information confidential by limiting individuals’ access to the research data and keeping it in a secure location. The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, only group results will be reported. All study data will be kept for at least three years.



What will happen to the information I provide in the research after the study is over?

After information that could identify you has been removed, de-identified responses may be used or distributed to investigators for other research without obtaining additional informed consent from you.



What will happen if I do not want to take part or decide later not to stay in the study?

Taking part is voluntary. It is your choice whether to take part in the research. You may choose to take part or not to take part, and you may change your mind and withdraw from the study at any time. If you wish to stop at any time, you can exit out of your browser and the experiment will be discontinued immediately. You may also refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable. You may also be able to withdraw your consent for use of data you submit, but you must do this in writing to the PIs Vanessa LoBue or Elizabeth Bonawitz. If you do not want to enter the study or decide to stop taking part, your relationship with the study staff will not change, and if you are affiliated with Rutgers University, declining to participate will not affect your standing or enrollment.



Who can I contact if I have questions?

If you have any questions about taking part in this study, please ask them now. If you have questions later, you may contact either of the Principal Investigators: Dr. Elizabeth Bonawitz [elizabeth.bonawitz@rutgers.edu; (973) 353-3944] or Dr. Vanessa LoBue [vlobue@psychology.rutgers.edu; (973) 353-3950]. You may also contact their Lab Manager, Elise Mahaffey, at elise.mahaffey@rutgers.edu or (973) 353-3938 with any questions.



If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, you may contact the Rutgers IRB Director at: Arts and Sciences IRB, 335 George St., Liberty Plaza Ste. 3200, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 (732) 235-2866 or the Rutgers Human Subjects Protection Program at (973) 972-1149, email us at humansubjects@ored.rutgers.edu or write us at 65 Bergen St., Suite 507, Newark, NJ 07107.
