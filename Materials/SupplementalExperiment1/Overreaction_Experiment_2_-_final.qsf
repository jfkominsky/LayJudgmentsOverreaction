During the session, you will be presented with objects or images, you may watch a video clip, perform a computer task, read brief paragraphs, look at pictures, and\/or answer a series of questionnaires. You may be asked to make judgements, answer questions (such as making predictions and providing explanations), learn from and teach others, observe events as well as perform actions such as moving or reaching toward certain objects, grouping objects, or activating toys.
